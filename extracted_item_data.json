Each swing seems to grow heavier, hungrier, as though it feeds upon the despair of its wielder.\n\nThose who wield this weapon are granted great power, but they must be wary—for it is said that the Soulslasher does not merely take life, but consumes the very soul of those it strikes, slowly corrupting its bearer with each kill.",
