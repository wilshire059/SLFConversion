SUMMARY
-------
The transitions are broken because they were connected to Blueprint variables
that NO LONGER EXIST after reparenting. The C++ class provides the same
variables (just without the "?" suffix), but the transitions are not connected.

ORIGINAL BLUEPRINT VARIABLES (now deleted):
  - bIsFalling? -> Replaced by C++ bIsFalling
  - IsResting?  -> Replaced by C++ IsResting  
  - Speed       -> Replaced by C++ Speed (same name)

THE 7 BROKEN TRANSITIONS:
1. To Falling to Fall Loop   - needs: Get bIsFalling -> Result
2. Land to Locomotion        - needs: Get bIsFalling -> NOT -> Result
3. IDLE to CYCLE             - needs: Get Speed -> > 10.0 -> Result
4. IDLE to SITTING           - needs: Get IsResting -> Result
5. CYCLE to SITTING          - needs: Get IsResting -> Result
6. CROUCH IDLE to SITTING    - needs: Get IsResting -> Result
7. CROUCH CYCLE to SITTING   - needs: Get IsResting -> Result

WHY THE USER'S FIXES DIDN'T WORK:
If you followed the instructions and it still shows warnings, you may have:
1. Connected to the wrong pin (must be the "Result" pin with "Can Enter Transition")
2. Not compiled/saved after making changes
3. The connection was made but the variable doesn't exist in current context

VERIFY FIX:
1. Open each transition (double-click the arrow between states)
2. Look for the Result node with "Can Enter Transition" checkbox
3. There should be a node chain ending at the Result pin
4. If Result is not connected, add the appropriate Get node
