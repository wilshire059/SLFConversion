MIGRATING BT DECORATORS FROM BLUEPRINT ENUM TO C++ INT VALUES
======================================================================

ESLFAIStates mapping:
  Idle=0, RandomRoam=1, Patrolling=2, Investigating=3
  Combat=4, PoiseBroken=5, Uninterruptable=6, OutOfBounds=7

Processing: BT_Idle (expected State=0)
  BehaviorTree: BT_Idle
  Expected State value: 0
  [0] Is State == Idle? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 0
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_RandomRoam (expected State=1)
  BehaviorTree: BT_RandomRoam
  Expected State value: 1
  [0] Is State == Random Roam? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 1
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_PatrolPath (expected State=2)
  BehaviorTree: BT_PatrolPath
  Expected State value: 2
  [0] Is State == Patrolling? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 2
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_Investigating (expected State=3)
  BehaviorTree: BT_Investigating
  Expected State value: 3
  [0] Is State == Investigating? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 3
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_Combat (expected State=4)
  BehaviorTree: BT_Combat
  Expected State value: 4
  [1] Is State == Combat? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 4
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_PoiseBroken (expected State=5)
  BehaviorTree: BT_PoiseBroken
  Expected State value: 5
  [0] Is State == Poise Broken? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 5
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_Uninterruptable (expected State=6)
  BehaviorTree: BT_Uninterruptable
  Expected State value: 6
  [0] Is State == Uninterruptable? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 6
      OK: IntValue already correct
  No changes needed.

Processing: BT_OutOfBounds (expected State=7)
  BehaviorTree: BT_OutOfBounds
  Expected State value: 7
  [0] Is State == Out of Bounds? - Key: State
      Current IntValue: 6
      FIXED: Set IntValue from 6 to 7
  Saved BehaviorTree with fixes.
